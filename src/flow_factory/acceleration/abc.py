"""Abstract base class for the model-agnostic acceleration plugin layer.

An accelerator is a pluggable speedup applied to a model adapter's transformer(s)
without touching trainer or model math. Each accelerator declares two markers that
the validator (:mod:`flow_factory.acceleration.validator`) uses to preserve
train-inference consistency against the trainer's RL paradigm:

* ``stage`` — *where/how* it is applied, and which config slot it belongs to:

  - ``"both"``: a persistent, one-time mutation via :meth:`setup` (e.g.
    ``torch.compile``, attention backend) applied to the module used by both rollout
    ``inference()`` and training ``forward()``. This marker describes application
    scope, not numerical exactness; ``safety`` records measured cross-stage behavior.
    Belongs in the ``shared`` slot.
  - ``"rollout"``: a per-epoch context via :meth:`rollout_context` (e.g. feature
    caching), torn down before the training forward. Belongs in the ``rollout`` slot.

* ``safety`` — the train-inference consistency class:

  - ``"lossless"``: **bit-exact across rollout and training**. For ``stage='rollout'``
    this means the rollout output is bit-identical to the un-accelerated forward; for
    ``stage='both'`` it means the shared transform produces identical results in both
    stages (an exact transform, or a symmetric-approximate one such as Sage int8
    attention whose same int8 kernel runs in both stages). Safe for any paradigm.
  - ``"lossy"``: **NOT bit-exact across the two stages.**

    - ``stage='rollout'`` + lossy (e.g. feature caching): rollout diverges from the
      training forward, which cannot replicate it — only safe when the rollout
      log-prob never feeds the loss, i.e. **decoupled / distillation** algorithms
      (validator *rejects* it on coupled; see ``constraints.md`` #7).
    - ``stage='both'`` + lossy (e.g. ``torch.compile``, whose grad/no-grad
      compiled-graph split leaves a ~1e-5 residual): applied symmetrically and stays
      within ``clip_range``, so it is *allowed* on any paradigm — but the validator
      *warns* on a coupled trainer that the on-policy PPO ratio will be ~1, not
      bit-exact.

Subclasses implement only what they need: ``setup`` defaults to a no-op,
``rollout_context`` defaults to yielding without modification.
