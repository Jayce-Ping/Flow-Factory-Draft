"""Attention-backend accelerator — the single code path that selects the
diffusers attention backend for every transformer.

This replaces the old ``BaseAdapter._set_attention_backend`` call and the
``model.attn_backend`` knob: the backend is now requested as an ``attention_backend``
entry in the acceleration ``shared`` list and applied here (after
``accelerator.prepare`` / ``post_init`` and before compile), so all transformer-level
acceleration flows through the same plugin mechanism.

The backend name is taken from the required ``backend`` param and forwarded to
diffusers' ``set_attention_backend`` verbatim — including approximate backends like
``sage`` — matching the previous behavior.

Marked ``stage='both'`` / ``safety='lossless'``: a backend is applied to the
transformer shared by rollout ``inference()`` and training ``forward()``, so the
two stay consistent (the property the validator's lossless category guarantees)
even for approximate kernels and coupled algorithms.
