    """Apply ``torch.compile`` to every transformer the adapter exposes.

    Stage-``both`` but ``safety='lossy'``. The compiled module backs both rollout
    ``inference()`` and the training ``forward()`` (they share ``adapter.transformer``),
    so it is applied *symmetrically* — but, unlike an exact or symmetric-approximate
    transform, ``torch.compile`` is NOT numerically identical across the two stages:
    Inductor compiles a separate graph for grad vs no-grad mode, and even with the
    grad-forced rollout fix below an intermittent ~1e-5 on-policy ratio residual remains
    on a minority of samples (see :meth:`_wrap_forward_grad_consistent`). That is why it
    is marked ``lossy`` rather than ``lossless`` (which here means *bit-exact across
    stages*, not merely "applied to the shared module").

    It stays well within ``clip_range`` — numerically on-policy — and is the main
    compute speedup on real hardware, so it remains a ``stage='both'`` accelerator
    allowed on coupled algorithms. The validator does not reject it, but it WARNS on a
    coupled trainer that the on-policy PPO ratio will be ~1, not bit-exact. Use eager or
    the ``attention_backend`` accelerator if a strictly bit-exact ratio is required.

    Both modes compile **in place** (``nn.Module.compile`` /
    ``compile_repeated_blocks``), which preserves parameter identity and leaves
    ``state_dict`` keys unchanged (no ``_orig_mod.`` prefix). Consequences:

    * **Checkpointing** stays correct — save/load operate on the same keys.
    * **EMA / reference / named-parameter swaps** stay correct — they mutate
      ``param.data`` in place (``copy_``), which the compiled graph reads.
    * **LoRA reference forwards** (``use_ref_parameters`` -> PEFT
      ``disable_adapter``) toggle control flow, so Dynamo recompiles the
      adapter-disabled path once; this is correct but adds a one-time recompile.

    Applied after ``post_init`` (see ``BaseTrainer._apply_shared_acceleration``),
    so it wraps the final, fully-loaded weights.

    Parameters (from the entry's ``params``):
        mode: ``"auto"`` (default) selects ``"regional"`` per transformer when
            the unwrapped base model declares non-empty ``_repeated_blocks``;
            otherwise it selects ``"full"``. ``"regional"`` forces diffusers'
            ``compile_repeated_blocks`` and fails when the declaration is absent.
            ``"full"`` compiles the whole module in place.
        compile_kwargs: Extra kwargs forwarded to the underlying compile call
            (e.g. ``{"mode": "max-autotune", "dynamic": true}``).

        Wraps the module's call entry point(s) so every forward runs under
        ``torch.enable_grad()`` — overriding the ``@torch.no_grad()`` on
        ``adapter.inference()``. This pins rollout (Stage 3) and the training forward
        (Stage 6) to the same grad-mode compiled path: Inductor compiles a separate,
        numerically non-identical graph for grad vs no-grad mode (Dynamo guards on
        ``grad_mode``), so a no-grad rollout would diverge from the grad training
        forward and undermine coupled on-policy consistency.

        Crucially the output is **NOT detached here**: detaching inside the wrapper
        lets Inductor see the result is unused-for-grad and pick a different
        (inference-optimized) kernel, re-introducing the divergence. The surrounding
        rollout stays under ``torch.no_grad()``, so scheduler and CFG operations do not
        extend the graph; collectors detach any direct model output before storage.
        Every transformer call still uses the same grad-mode compiled path (near-exact
        velocity → on-policy ratio ≈ 1 within ``clip_range``).

        Known residual (NOT strictly bit-exact): forcing grad removes the *dominant*
        divergence (the grad-vs-no-grad graph split), but it does not make the rollout
        and training forwards a literally identical Inductor kernel invocation. They are
        different call sites: the stored-then-reloaded latents may differ in
        stride/contiguity, and the surrounding autograd graphs differ (rollout detaches
        stored outputs and discards the graph; training keeps it and backwards). For some
        inputs Inductor's shape/layout-specialized, autotuned kernels then take a
        different reduction order, and bf16's non-associative accumulation turns that
        into an *intermittent* ~1e-5 on-policy ratio drift on a minority of
        samples/ranks (value-dependent — some runs/shardings show exactly 0). This is
        well within ``clip_range`` (1e-4), i.e. numerically on-policy, but not
        bit-exact. Eager and the attention-backend accelerator stay exactly 0
        (an attention kernel's forward is grad-mode-independent). Measured on 16×H20
        (2-node ZeRO-2/FSDP2): SD3.5 full compilation, Qwen-Image regional/full
        compilation, and CFG/no-CFG.

        Two entry points must be covered because the two compile modes dispatch
        differently:
          * ``mode='regional'`` (``compile_repeated_blocks``): the top ``forward``
            stays eager and calls the compiled blocks — wrapping ``forward`` suffices.
          * ``mode='full'`` (``nn.Module.compile``): ``module(...)`` routes through
            ``module._compiled_call_impl``, bypassing a reassigned ``forward`` — so
            that attribute must be wrapped too.
