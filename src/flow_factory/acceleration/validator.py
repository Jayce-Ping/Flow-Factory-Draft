"""Paradigm-gated safety validation for accelerators (fail-fast, ``constraints.md`` #26).

The correctness contract (``constraints.md`` #7) hinges on **symmetric
application**, encoded by ``stage``, not on numerical bit-exactness:

* ``stage='both'`` accelerators mutate the transformer persistently, so the same
  transform runs in both rollout ``inference()`` and training ``forward()``. When that
  transform is identical across the two stages (exact, or symmetric-approximate like
  Sage int8 attention) rollout and training stay CONSISTENT — safe for any algorithm.
  They belong in the ``shared`` slot and are never rejected. ``safety`` is only used to
  *warn*: a ``stage='both'`` + ``lossy`` accelerator (e.g. ``torch.compile``, which is
  applied symmetrically but is not bit-exact across stages due to its grad/no-grad
  graph split) is still allowed, but on a **coupled** trainer the on-policy PPO ratio
  will be ≈1, not exactly 1, so the validator logs a warning.
* ``stage='rollout'`` accelerators run only during Stage-3 rollout. If such an
  accelerator changes outputs (``safety='lossy'``, e.g. feature caching), rollout
  diverges from the training forward, which it cannot be replicated in (that needs
  full gradient through every block). That is only safe when the rollout
  trajectory's log-prob never feeds the loss — i.e. **decoupled** / **distillation**
  algorithms. For **coupled** algorithms (GRPO / GRPO-Guard / DPPO) the rollout
  log-prob becomes the PPO "old log-prob", so a divergent rollout biases the
  importance ratio -> silently wrong gradients. A bit-identical rollout accelerator
  (``safety='lossless'``) is safe for any paradigm.
