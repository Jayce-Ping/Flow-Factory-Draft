    The framework prepares exactly one optimizer root, because DeepSpeed builds one
    engine and FSDP2 wraps one root. Some algorithms nevertheless need two update
    rules at once: ``torch.optim.Muon`` rejects any parameter that is not a matrix,
    so a Muon-optimized variant also needs AdamW for its biases, normalization
    parameters and embeddings.

    This holds those children and exposes their parameter groups as one list, so
    every reader (gradient clipping, checkpointing, the role coordinator) sees the
    layout it expects. It deliberately implements nothing beyond delegation.
