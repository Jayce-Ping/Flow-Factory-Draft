"""Trainers that optimize toward another model rather than toward a reward.

The target is a teacher, a frozen pretrained score, or an earlier copy of the
policy itself, so these algorithms have no reward or advantage stage; their
``prepare_feedback`` is a no-op. Reward-driven algorithms live in
``trainers.rl``.

Modules are imported lazily through ``trainers.registry``, so nothing is
re-exported here; importing this package must not pull in every trainer.
